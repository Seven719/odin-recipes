			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Heat the oven to 160/140 fan/gas 3. Use a small sharp knife to remove any white membrane from the ribs, being careful not to cut the flesh, then put on a baking tray. Combine the cumin, paprika and cayenne in a small bowl with a big pinch of salt, then rub all over the ribs. Add 3 tbsp of water to the tray, cover tightly with foil and bake for 3 hrs until the meat is falling off the bone.</li>
				<li>When the ribs are nearly done, combine the remaining ingredients in a small pan and bring to a simmer. Cook for 1-2 mins until combined and reduced slightly. Brush all over the ribs and bake again, uncovered for 10 mins until sticky. Serve straightaway.</li>
